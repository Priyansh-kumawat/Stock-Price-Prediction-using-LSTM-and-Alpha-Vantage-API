# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and Alpha Vantage

Project Overview: 

This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, for predicting stock prices. Leveraging data fetched from Alpha Vantage’s API, the project focuses on creating a time-series forecasting model that predicts stock prices based on historical data.


## Features

- Fetching daily stock price data using the Alpha Vantage API.

- Preprocessing stock data, including scaling and splitting it for training and testing.

- Creating sequences of time-step data for model training.

- Implementing an LSTM model for stock price prediction.

- Visualizing stock price trends and model predictions.


## Tech Stack

- Python: Programming language used for implementation.

- Alpha Vantage: Source for retrieving stock price data.

- Libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: Numerical computations.

matplotlib: Data visualization.

scikit-learn: Data preprocessing.

Keras: Deep learning library for building the LSTM model.


## Data Flow

1. Data Retrieval:

- Stock data is fetched for a specific stock symbol using Alpha Vantage.

- The data is saved as a CSV file for analysis and modeling.

2. Data Preprocessing:

- Scaling stock prices using MinMaxScaler to ensure compatibility with LSTM input.

- Splitting the dataset into training (65%) and testing (35%) subsets.

- Generating time-step sequences using a helper function.

- Reshaping data into 3D format suitable for LSTM.

3. Model Implementation:

- Building an LSTM model with layers configured to handle sequential data.

- Training the model on historical stock prices.

- Evaluating the model using the testing dataset.

4. Visualization:

- Plotting stock prices and model predictions to visualize performance.

## Results

The LSTM model effectively learned patterns in historical stock data and provided predictions for future prices. Visualizations demonstrated the alignment of predicted prices with actual stock movements, validating the model’s performance.
## Challenges

- Handling missing or incomplete data during preprocessing.

- Optimizing the model’s architecture and hyperparameters for better accuracy.

- Ensuring the time-series split respected the sequential nature of stock prices.


## Deployment

I am working on the frontend part for this model.The project can be further extended for real-time deployment by integrating the LSTM model with a front-end interface. For example, the model can predict and visualize live stock data trends.


## Optimizations

- Implement additional deep learning models for comparison, such as GRU or CNN-LSTM hybrids.

- Use multiple stock symbols to create a portfolio-level forecasting system.

- Incorporate sentiment analysis on financial news for improving predictions.


## Acknowledgements

- Alpha Vantage for providing free access to stock price data.

- Open-source libraries like TensorFlow/Keras for enabling deep learning experimentation.
